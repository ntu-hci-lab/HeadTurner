## Overview
HeadTurner is an innovative system designed to improve comfort and viewing range for users of virtual and mixed reality (VR/MR) headsets, such as the Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest, when used in reclined positions. As VR/MR technology evolves to accommodate various postures, HeadTurner addresses the ergonomic challenges associated with limited head and shoulder mobility while lying down.

## Key Features
* **Adaptive Surface Actuation:** HeadTurner assists user-initiated head rotations by dynamically adjusting the resting surface in pitch and yaw axes, facilitating a more natural range of motion.​

* **Enhanced Viewing Range:** In user studies, HeadTurner significantly expanded the horizontal field of view from 130º to 261º and the vertical field from 94.9º to 172º, compared to a fixed surface.​

* **Improved Comfort:** Participants reported increased comfort during extended VR/MR sessions, with 75% preferring HeadTurner over traditional setups.

## User Impact
By enabling more natural head movements in reclined positions, HeadTurner enhances the immersive experience of VR/MR applications, reducing physical strain and increasing accessibility for users who prefer or require lying down.

---
## Potential Applications
* **Healthcare and Rehabilitation:** Facilitates VR-based therapies for patients confined to beds, offering engaging and comfortable experiences.​

* **Entertainment:** Enhances comfort for users engaging in extended VR gaming or media consumption sessions while reclining.​

* **Work and Education:** Supports professionals and students who utilize VR/MR for remote collaboration or learning in various postures.

## Future Developments
While the current prototype is designed as a bed, the underlying approach of HeadTurner can be adapted to more compact and affordable form factors, such as motorized reclining chairs, broadening its applicability across different settings.​

HeadTurner serves as a significant step toward more ergonomic and accessible VR/MR experiences in reclined positions. By addressing the limitations of head and shoulder mobility, it opens new possibilities for immersive applications across healthcare, entertainment, and education sectors.
