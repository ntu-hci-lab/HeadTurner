Hello, this is the description of the files in this folder named Application Analysis.

This folder contains six files in total, and here is an introduction to the use of each file.

First, please ensure you have RStudio or any other R code IDE installed beforehand, 
so we can proceed with the following steps. You can follow this installation instruction 
for RStudio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaHsmgULh7I

Then, open RStudio and locate the console. Please type install.packages("ggplot2") in the 
console and press Enter, as we will be using ggplot2 in the code.

In SourceCode.R, we have documented the plans we developed during the research period. 
Currently, we are using plan 4 to demonstrate the analysis of head rotation when using different apps.
This file serves as a record of our "thinking path," and it may appear somewhat messy.
You can skip this file if you only want to know how to create the plots for the paper. 
However, if you want to understand our thought process, you can refer to this file and follow the comments within the code.

In Plan 4(Real).R, you will find all the necessary code to generate the required plots.
Please follow the instructions in that file.

The remaining .csv files are the raw data files, which contain the data we used for analysis. 
They record our head positions over different time periods using various apps, and the app name is the file name. 
Please ensure your file names correspond to the appropriate app names if you want to use your raw data files 
as references to utilize the R code in Plan 4(Real).R to create your plots.

At last, thank you for your patience!
